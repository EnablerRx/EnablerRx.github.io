# About Me

Hi, my name is Jie Ruan. Currently, I am a first-year PhD student at University of Michigan. I was fortunate to have Prof. [Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/) as my advisor and I am a member of [LAUNCH Lab](https://launch.eecs.umich.edu/). 

I received my master degree at Peking University, advised by Prof. Yuesheng Zhu, Prof Xiaojun Wan and Prof. Guibo Luo.

I received my master degree at Peking University, advised by Prof. Yuesheng Zhu and Prof. Guibo Luo. I was also fortunate to work closely with Prof. Xiaojun Wan.

My research interest broadly lies in AI and its constructive impacts on humanity. I aspire to deliver Trustworthy and Human-centered AI, including areas such as reliable evaluation, human-AI collaboration, and AI safety. And I am dedicated to unleashing the full potential of imperfect AI in practical applications, emphasizing effective collaboration between humans and AI, especially in fields like medicine, social good, and science.

Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to discuss research or explore potential collaboration!
