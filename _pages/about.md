<!-- 
I am currently pursuing a master's degree at Peking University, focusing on natural language generation and evaluation. 

My research interest broadly lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its constructive impacts on humanity. I aspire to deliver Trustworthy and Human-centered AI, including areas such as reliable evaluation, human-AI collaboration, and AI safety. And I am dedicated to unleashing the full potential of imperfect AI in practical applications, emphasizing effective collaboration between humans and AI, especially in fields like medicine, social good, and science.


If you are interested in collaboration, please reach out! I'm more than happy to chat about opportunities here!
