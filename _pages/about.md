I am currently pursuing a master's degree at Peking University, focusing on natural language generation and evaluation, and I am seeking a Ph.D. position. My research interest broadly lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its constructive impacts on humanity. I aspire to deliver Trustworthy and Human-centered AI, including areas such as reliable evaluation, human-AI collaboration, and AI safety. And I am dedicated to unleashing the full potential of imperfect AI in practical applications, emphasizing effective collaboration between humans and AI, especially in fields like medicine, social good, and science.
